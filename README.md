Overview
This repository contains the implementation of variational data assimilation (DA) methods for the differentiable HBV (Œ¥HBV) hydrological model, as described in the paper:
"Update hydrological states or meteorological forcings? Comparing data assimilation methods for differentiable hydrologic models"
Jamaat, A., Song, Y., Rahmani, F., Liu, J., & Shen, C. (2024)
The code implements three distinct data assimilation approaches:

HBV-DA-S: State-only adjustment
HBV-DA-P: Precipitation-only adjustment
HBV-DA-PS: Combined state and precipitation adjustment

Key Features
üéØ Three Assimilation Modes

State-Only Mode (state_only): Optimizes hydrological state variables (snowpack, soil moisture, meltwater, upper/lower zone storage) to minimize prediction errors
Precipitation-Only Mode (precip_only): Adjusts precipitation inputs using an optimizable multiplier (k‚Å¥) to correct forcing data errors
State + Precipitation Mode (state_precip): Combines both approaches for maximum effectiveness

üîß Technical Implementation

GPU-Accelerated: Leverages PyTorch for automatic differentiation and GPU computation
Batch Processing: Processes multiple basins simultaneously for efficiency
Flexible Time Configuration: Supports both calendar dates and day indices
Optimization: Uses Adadelta optimizer with configurable learning rates
Windowed Approach: 5-day assimilation window for optimal performance
